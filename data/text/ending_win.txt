Look at that! The plumbus is dissolving the lock! Wow, these things are super useful. L-l-let that be a lesson to you, Morty. Never leave home without a plumbus!
Ok, the lock is destroyed! I can't believe we found Summer! We didn't even have to kidnap a version of Summer from an alternate reality.
W-w-w-we're actually ending an adventure in the original dimension where we started, and most of the people here are still alive!
Unbelievable.  Seriously! We totally did it!
Well whatever, I'm gonna take a nap, just you and Summer try to actually not violate inter-dimensional law again please. That'd be *urp* really helpful.

WubaLubaDubDub! Thanks for playing!
