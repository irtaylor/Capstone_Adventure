Jeeze, Morty. I can't believe we found Summer! W-w-w-we're actually ending an adventure in the original dimension where we started, and most of the people here are still alive!
Unbelievable. We even saved your sister without having to kidnap a version of herself from an alternate reality or dimension. Seriously! We totally did it!

Well whatever, I'm gonna take a nap, just you and Summer try to actually not violate inter-dimensional law again please. That'd be *urp* really helpful.

WubaLubaDubDub! Thanks for playing!
