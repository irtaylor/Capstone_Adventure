Jeeze, Morty. I can't believe we made it back to Earth. W-w-w-we're actually ending an adventure in the original dimension where we started, and most of the people here are still alive!
Unbelievable. We even saved your sister without having to kidnap an alternate version of her from an alternate reality. Seriously! We totally did it!

Well whatever, I'm gonna take a nap, just you and Summer try to actually not violate inter-dimensional law again please. That'd be *urp* really helpful.

WubaLubaDubDub! Thanks for playing!
