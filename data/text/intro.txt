Rick and Morty's Command-Line Adventure:
by Stephanie Creamer, Kyle Bergman, and Ian Taylor

As Read to you by Rick Sanchez:
Welcome to Earth Dimension C-137 -- one of an infinite number of Planet Earths in the Multiverse! As it happens, in this particular dimension, on this particular planet, in this particular Earth dimension, Morty's sister, Summer, has gone missing. Ugh, really? Are we really doing a long text intro thing? I-i-i-t's way too hard to read all this. *Urp*. No, seriously, I'm done.
Alright, fine... *Urp* If you wanna save Summer and blah-blah-Multiverse-something-not-fun, you'll have to waste my time, money, and resources finding her.
Or, ya, know, we could just chill out? Ok, fine! We'll find your sister!
