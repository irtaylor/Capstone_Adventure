Sorry Rick, I-I-I just get really nervous around these Pluto guys\" Morty then fumbles putting ray gun back into his bag, dropping the gun to the ground.  *PEW*PEW*PEW*  The gun fires upon impact and hits random machinery, destroying it. However, it looks like some of the processors powering the machine could be useful in powering our portal gun, better grab one. \"Well Morty, that could have gone a lot worse. Just don't let that reinforce the idea that being a fumbling moron will let you succeed later in life. That's for celebrities.",
