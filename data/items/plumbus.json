Morty: \"I don't know what's happening, but I think it's working!\" Rick: \"Well whoda thunk it, Morty, the plumbus wasn't the useless sack of crap I thought it was.\" Once the lock was completely gone, Rick and Morty grab Summer and dart out of the prison.

Thanks for taking time away from your busy day of failing school and creating dangerous science experiments to come save me. \" Morty: \"Shut up, Summer\"",
